1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,859
 How are these so good? What do you put in them?

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,419
 60 years of my damn life! I have you!

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,640
 That kid... You got lucky, that's all.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,939
 Lucky? Five days straight I've been lucky.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,760
 And I better keep being lucky until whoever you're waiting for finally shows.

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,079
 Four, please.

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,440
 I've met your grandson, I think. He looks like you.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,820
 A younger, angrier you. Where is he? Is he okay?

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,159
 He's fine.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,780
 But he sent you for the dumplings.

11
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,420
 He said they were the best in town.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,399
 You bet your ass they are.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:48,140
 He told me you put 60 years of your life worth it.

14
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,380
 You told me.
